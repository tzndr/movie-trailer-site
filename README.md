# Movie Trailer Site
## Description
Movie Trailer Treasure Chest is a site created as the first project submission for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer        Nanodegree. This site has content containing titles, poster art, and trailers of a selection of movies. It is created with Python, HTML and CSS.

## Viewing the Site
To view, save all files in a common directory, open the file `main.py` in Python 2 or 3 and click `RUN` and `RUN MODULE`. Your default browser will open and display the html file created upon running main.py. Each movie poster art will display that particular movie's trailer once clicked.
